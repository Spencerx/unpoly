Layer terminology
=================

Unpoly allows you to stack multiple pages on top of each other.
Each stack element is called a [*layer*](/up.layer).

The kind of layer (e.g. a modal dialog vs. a popup box) is called *mode*.

The initial page is called the *root layer*.
An *overlay* is any layer that is not the root layer.

Available modes
---------------

| Mode      | Description                           | Overlay? |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |----------|
| `root`    | The initial page                      | no       |
| `modal`   | A modal dialog box                    | yes      |
| `drawer`  | A drawer sliding in from the side     | yes      |
| `popup`   | A popup menu anchored to a link       | yes      |
| `cover`   | An overlay covering the entire screen | yes      |

The default mode for [new overlays](/up-layer-new) is `modal`.
You can change this in `up.layer.config.mode`.

You may configure default attributes for each layer mode in `up.layer.config`.
